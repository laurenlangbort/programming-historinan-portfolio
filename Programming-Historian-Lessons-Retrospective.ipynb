    "<p> Brief Recap: I picked out this lesson because I wanted to learn more about librarys you can use in python. I am a CBS major and often create datasets for research so I thought it would be cool to try and learn in Python. Plotly was really cool. In this lesson I learned different plot systems that could be created with plotly, like scatter graphs, bar graphs, and line graphs. I also learned how to have more customization over the graphs like using facet plots to compare different subsets of data like separating by gender and comparing the outcomes. Also one of my favorite parts of the lessons was learning the animations for graphs with an animation frame, where you can input a certain variable to measure for change. </p>\n"

    "<p> Brief Recap: This was one of the homework assignments. I have a bit of coding knowledge so when I think about finding the word frequency, I would only think about using a python dictionary. But this lesson went more in depth to use obo.py. This lesson helped me with dealing with tokenization issues. It showed how to filter out stop words and punctionation which is really helpful in text analysis. </p>\n"
